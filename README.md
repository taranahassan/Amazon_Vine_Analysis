# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

The Amazon Vine program is a service provided for manufacturers/publisher.  They can choose to pay for the service in order to get reviews for their products.  Vine members would then be required to provide a review.<br>
This analysis focuses on the success rate of purchasing the Vine program.  For this analysis, I've selected reviews on kitchen products that are sold on Amazon.  

Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
